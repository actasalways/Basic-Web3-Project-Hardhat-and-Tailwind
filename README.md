# Basic Web3 Project

Login with metamask and transfers desired amount of eth to another ethereum address

Used technologys;
- React (Front-end framework)
- Tailwind (CSS Framework)
- Ropsten Test Network (for test ethereum network)
- Giphy (Gif platform) 
- Hardhat (Development Environment)

## What is Tailwind
Tailwind CSS is the only framework that I've seen scale on large teams. Itâ€™s easy to customize, adapts to any design, and the build size is tiny.

## What is Hardhat
Easily deploy your contracts, run tests and debug Solidity code without dealing with live environments. Hardhat Network is a local Ethereum network designed for development.

Hardhat is the best choice for Solidity debugging. You get Solidity stack traces, console.log and explicit error messages when transactions fail.
